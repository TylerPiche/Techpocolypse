         While your back at HQ teaching the techies, or just bored in your free time, you may also want to look into something else to do:

       <img src="Images/poem.png" alt="Literally the word poem" class=" poem-image">
       <div class="about-poem">
         The poem , <i><a target="_blank" href="https://manversespoetry.com/2013/06/15/poetic-attempt-attachment/">Addiction</a></i> by Cdkeimling is a wonderful read about a poet who became infatuated with his
         phone and slowly came to realize that his infatuation was too much.

       <img src="Images/book.jpg" alt="Rule of three book" class="book-image">
       <div class="about-book">
         If you're more into fictional novels, I mean entirely real and currently happening novels, you should
         check out <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934467-the-rule-of-three">The Rule of Three</a></i> by Eric Walters. In this riveting novel, main character Adam must bring together
         his dismayed neighbourhood after a massive EMP destroys all technology.
       </div>
       <img src="Images/walle.jpg" alt="WALL-E movie cover" class="movie-image">
       <div class="about-movie">
         And for when you simply don't want to read, you can watch a movie about robots, called <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/walle/">WALL-E</a></i>
         directed by Andrew Stanton, or if you don't know/care who that is, Pixar. The movie follows the titular character
         in his pursuit of love while he deals with the remains of earth and discovers the truth about the humans who destroyed it
       <p>
         If you would like something a little more intellectual for a change, you could also look into
         some websites such as this <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it/index.html">one</a></i> all about
         cyberbullying and how to stop with it or deal with it. Or you could look at <i><a target="_blank" href="https://studydemic.com/people-become-overly-dependent-technology-essay-sample/">this one</a></i> where the question of,
         how dependent are we, is questioned and disscused.
