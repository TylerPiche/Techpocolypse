          Now that all the boring stuff is out of the way, we can go make a
          difference in this tech ridden world.
      </p>
      <p>
          First were going to have to find the techies. Some of the richer ones
          will be out wandering the streets using data to fill their addictions,
          but the smart Idea would be to start with the isolated ones.
          Once we find a techie in need, we need to find what their issue is
          and help them.

          The sore and tired one's will benefit from simply looking away from
          their phones and computers. Our smartest scientists say that helping
          eye strain is as simple as focusing on something for 20 seconds every
          20 minutes. If were the ones that they focus on, we may even be able
          to start a conversation

          Which leads me to my next point. We need to make the techies talk.
          The more face to face action we get from them, the more their real
          life social skills will develop, and if we use big words around them,
          then we should be able to rid the text slang from their mouths.
          Talking also accomplishes the goal of giving someone a friend. I don't
          no about you, but I want to be everybody's friend, and that starts with
          introducing yourself to them. If we take them with us, then we should be able
          to take their minds off social media and show them that there really is
          more to this world than hurtful words said by silly little pictures
          next to text boxes.
      </p>
      <p>
          The gamers are gonna be a little bit harder, as most of them were seen
          to hate sports. We can start easy by finding the gamers who play sport
          games, and teach them how to play it with others outside. Not to mention,
          if we get the non sporty gamers outside, maybe they will start to enjoy
          spectating as much as youtube Let's Plays.
      </p>
      <p>
          The scared and broken techies, the ones who can't live without their
          precious refrigerators, will be simply fixed by a few survival lessons.
          I'd say we can call it a day when we get a group back to the HQ,
          then we can help them from their.
          With the knowledge I've saved since the collapse, we have the power to
          save every techie out their, all we need to do is try. With all of the
          resistance working together, I believe in us! Which is amazing because
          I don't even have emotions!
