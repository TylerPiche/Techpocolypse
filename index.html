        If you are reading this then you must be the newest member of our resistance.
    Resistance against what you may be wondering? Well, the machines of course!
    You seem to have amnesia, or some other convenient plot device, so let me
    explain what's going on here.

    <p>
        A long time ago, in 1876, phones were created so that people could talk over
    long distances, and man were they great. After a little spit and polish, and some time later,
    everybody had one! And it didn't stop there. Phones started to take on more abilities,
    like play music, show the person you are talking to and even talk
    back when you ask questions. Amazing!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        But of course, that's when they started getting smart, they were controlling
    people without them even knowing. People started quickly throwing away their
    lives staring into these amazing little boxes and missing the things around them.
    Kids too! They had their childhoods brutally taken away from them, spending
    more time texting and watching silly videos then actually exploring the world and smelling the roses.
    </p>
    <p>
        The invasion was slow at first, starting with phones and computers taking 
    everybody's attention out of the sky. Then the drones and VR hit and we knew
    we had lost them. People started to change, they were talking weird languages,
    saying things like "LOL" and always talking about memes. The few sensible
    humans who were left started dying of old age and most of the rest becameâ€¦ <strong>the techies!</strong>
    </p>
      <img src="Images/kids.jpg" alt="The Techies" class="about-band-image-2">
    <p>
        The techies are mindless wanders who never stop texting. They never 
        look up from their phones, or spend all of their time on computers. 
        When you try to disturb them they get angry and start saying things 
        like "O-M-G, can you believe this guy, did he, like, really just do that!""
    </p>
    <p>
        But all that aside, it is time for your assignment, if you choose to accept it.
    Together, with the resistance, we will tell the techies about the world around 
    them and open their eyes to what life was like before technology.
    Of course because of your extremely inconvenient amnesia, I'm going to tell 
    you all about how 
    <strong>The Humans Dependence On Technology Had Become Problematic To The Social Conditions And Health Of Humans!</strong>
