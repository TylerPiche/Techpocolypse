      <p>
          To properly understand the enemy, we must first know as much as we can,
          so if I can recall correctly,  there should be file in my database about good technology, like me!
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting with phones, like I said before,they were created by a really
        smart guy named Alexander Graham Bell. The technology was revolutionary
        for communication and really quickly got better and easier to use. Then
        in 1973, the technology went handheld and started to spread faster. Once
        smartphones started getting introduced,the market really took off,
        because now phones could stand in for T.V.'s, radios, cameras, and
        calculators. Almost everything could be quickly replaced by cell phones,
        and with the introduction of internet to phones, even computers started to become less important.
      </p>

      <p>
         But then computers started to get better, which led to even more non
         hardware breakthroughs. Computers started becoming databases where
         information could be stored for large groups of people, which helped
         companies form. Software also started to get stronger which created
         powerful A.I.'s, some of which can drive cars. Or in your case, ironically
         teach you about itself.
      </p>
      <p>
          With the increasing power of computers, and technology getting smaller
          and easier to access, humans also started to understand more about the
          world around them. Medical technology was a large breakthrough
          that shook many people's understanding of the human body. People who
          should have been dying were being given second chances, and cures were
          being administered for diseases before the humans even contracted
          the illness! The best part was that there were no side effects to having the cure
          injected!
      </p>
      <img src="Images/lightbulb.jpg" alt="Lightbulb" class="about-band-image-2 light" >
      <p>
          There are also technologies that had become so important that many
          people started taking them for granted. In the world we live in now,
          where very few fully sentient humans still roam free, and many services
          already shut down, it's easy to forget the absolute marvels that were
          refrigerators, or light bulbs. Lighting up rooms is a job left almost
          entirely to natural means like candles, or a ton of hamsters running on
          wheels to keep a fully sentient A.I. running, and keeping food cool
          is achieved by digging holes deep into the ground where it's colder.

      </p>
      <p>
          Before the great collapse, and yes thats what im calling it now,
          because it sounds really cool, technology was also commonly used as a
          teaching tool, and helped people achieve great things, like learning
          about the hidden meaning behind some extremely cryptic playwrights. A
          few websites were even so popular before the collapse that they had groups
          of fans throwing money at them just to keep it running, sometimes as much as $3.

      </p>
      <img src="Images/car.jpg" alt="Fancy lookin car" class="about-band-image car">
      <p>
          And finally, one of the most important pieces of technology was the
          super high tech cars, planes and boats that moved people and items by
          the thousands. Transportation was originally a low-tech operation,
          consisting mainly of metal boxes with wheels and engines to make the
          wheels spin. As time went on however, cars started to get computers
          that had A.I.'s smart enough to drive the car for them. Without the
          electronics within, the little engine that could became the fancy engine that
          couldn't. And boats were massive industrial works of art that had
          displays, computer systems, communications and cameras that helped
          the ship run smoothly. Planes were hit the hardest, as almost every
          working aspect of a plane required some kind of technology to function
          properly, so most planes were left on runways, to become homes for families and groups who survived in airports.

      </p>
      <h2 class="section-header">Next Things Next: The Not So Good</h2>
      <img src="Images/laser.jpg" alt="Really expensive laser pointer" class="about-band-image-2">
      <p>
          The topic of transportation also seems like a good Segway point to
          talk more about the bad sides of technology. Keeping with the movement
          theme, the rise of technology also brought more death machines.
          The construction process of things like bullets and bombs are left
          almost entirely to robots to create which lead to more deadly tanks and
          planes. Technology also created much smarter and faster targeting
          systems to increase the lethality of larger bombs and plane bombings.
          Boats also got assisted with the introduction of sonar technologies,
          which could be seen as good and bad. That part depends on what side
          of the boat your on.

      </p>
      <p>
         As for the smaller techs that were lost quickly to the collapse,
         some people became so dependent on such technologies that they had a
         hard time adapting to the changed world. Once gasoline ran out,
         people who relied on automobiles lost the ability to travel, and people
         who lacked survival skills were sorely disappointed when their food
         started to decay and their house started to fall apart with no repair people
         left to call.

      </p>
      <p>
          The Techies also had some issues before we lost them for good. Most of
          them acquired the groutchyness from the blurred and strained eyes that
          they developed from looking at their phones all day, and became stuck
          in a texting position from the severe pain from neck strain and sitting
          for prolonged periods.

      </p>
      <p>
          Coupled with the physical damage caused by technology, the techies
          also started experiencing social skill deficits. Oddly ironic don't you
          think? The people who spend the most time communicating can't understand
          social cues. The techies grew distant from us because of this, losing
          the ability to read body language, or understand tone of voice.

      </p>
      <p>
          Right before they lost their humanity, everything took a hard dark turn.
          Because of technology like cell phones, and social media like facebook,
          the rates of depression started to increase because of increased cyber
          bullying. The worst part is, nearly 43% of kids were being cyber-bullied
          before the collapse. A lot of these kids were able to put down their
          phones, but now live lonely lives, and in danger of themselves. Which
          means we need to go save them! And by we I mean you, of
          course.

      </p>
      <img src="Images/rage.jpg" alt="dude, calm down" class="about-band-image car">
      <p>
          But before you go, I should warn you that not all techies are sad,
          some are incredibly angry. Technology like video games have led to
          the development of narcissism in a lot of people, which leads to easy
          aggravation. As I was scouring through the ancient databases, I found
          that a lot of these "Rage-ers" as they were called, would make
          videos of them getting angry at video games for others to watch.
          Some of them were extremely famous too.

      </p>
      <p>
          With the history and understanding behind us, now we can move on to
          how were going to put this into action!
